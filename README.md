# Scarlet - Bringing the power of Rust to the frontend

I have found myself woefulling unfamiliar with Rust's idioms, despite the power and speed that the language provides. When it comes to these kind of things, I usually try to build some kind of simple project in Rust to help learn how to use it. The intent here is to build a Rust library that operates similarly to jQuery: making Javascript queries powerful and useful.

This is named after "Scarlet Spiders," a group of Spiderman outfitted with Iron Spider suits in the Marvel comics. Given that JavaScript takes place on the "web", and that a characteristic of iron is "rust", I decided to roll with this name.
